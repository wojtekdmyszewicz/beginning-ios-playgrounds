//: ## Variables Exercises
//: In these exercises, you will create variables and constants, and you will handle simple compiler areas that arise when working with them.
/*:
### Exercise 1

For each of the following names and types, create a variables or constant that best represents it:

- boilingPointOfWaterInCelsius (Double)
- gallonsRemainingInTank (Double)
- naturalLogarithmicBase (Double)
- ageOfSpecimenInWeeks (Int)
- studentNickname (String)
*/

//: ### Exercise 2
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to assignment, variables, and constants:
var favoriteLanguage: Character = "Swift"
gallonsRemainingInTank = "2"
ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 32.45
let _numberOfGasIcons: Int = gallonsRemainingInTank
let numberOfPolygonsInModel = 30
numberOfPolygonsInModel = 32
let polygonsLeftToDraw = 0
polygonsLeftToDraw = numberOfPolygonsInModel

//: ### Exercise 3
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to invalid names:
var n@meOfSchool = "Udacity"
var class = "Math"
let import = "Nissian"
var 🐩myDog! = "🐶"
var 🐕yourDog? = "🐶"
